Reverse Engineering
===================

**This repository contains some of the executables that I've cracked.**

Exploits
-----------

Some of the exploits that I created for learning purposes, and stuff that I use during Red Team engagements. Big thanks to @lldre for teaching me this.

The challenges
-------------

Every challenges directory contains Crackme's and other challenges. It includes the original ``crackme.exe`` to solve including the patches, loaders or keygens that I created. The ``README.rst`` includes the level of difficulty, the source I got the crackme from and the author's crackme instructions.
